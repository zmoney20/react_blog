## Aerials, my greatest weakness

I love games that have high skill caps. Super Smash Bros Melee is a great
example of this. The game can be played with families in a non-competetive
environment, or it could be played in MLG tournaments. For a game that's nearly
20 years old, it's ridiculous how much we are still learning today.

Rocket League is the exact same, but only a whole lot newer. Still, for a game
that's running on six years, new mechanics are being found every day that change
the game forever.

I am currently ranked Platinum III in Rocket League. Platinum is often considered
the rank where players go from casual to competetive. Everyone starts to take the game
more seriously, but as a consequence, it becomes a lot more toxic.

To overcome my toxic enemies and teammates, I decided to 'get gud' and practice
skills that would push me higher in rank. My biggest weakness at this point is
aerials, where your car flies in the air to hit the ball, either to a teammate
or to shoot the ball.

After a few Youtube searches, I found out about air roll left. You can map this
to any button (I chose X on Xbox) and it will twist your car to the left while
you're in the air. While your car is constantly rotating, you can make micro adjustments
to correct your car to go down the path you want it to go.

An example:

This can get complicated because while your car is upside down, the inputs are
reversed. With enough practice, this becomes muscle memory and you are able to
adjust your car without much thought. I'm at a point where I'm comfortable with
it, but not to a point where I would prefer it over no spin at all.
