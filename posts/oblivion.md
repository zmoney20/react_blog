## Lizard Wizard, the greatest wizard of all

Recently, I have been playing quite a bit of Skyrim. Skyrim was the first
Elder Scrolls game I ever played, and it's always been a favorite of mine ever
since its release date all the way back in 2011. I started getting tired of
trying to find new ways to enjoy the game. I had created just about every type
of character I could think of:

- Sneaky Archer (always fun)
- Sword and Shield
- Sneaky Assassin
- Thief
- Pacifist Monk
- Healer/Support Mage

I could go on and list all of the different character builds I've tried, but
that would be a waste of time. Needless to say there are countless ways to play
the game, and all are fun in their own unique ways.

### Enter Oblivion

From the ugliest characters in the world to the worst AI ever, this game is a
breath of fresh air. A true masterpiece.

A couple friends of mine grew up playing Oblivion, the Elder Scrolls game
before Skyrim. They suggested that I try it out. Everyone that I've ever talked
to that has played both Oblivion and Skyrim has always said that Oblivion is
more fun. Luckily, I found Oblivion online for only $8. I had to break out my
old Xbox 360 which luckily still works.

The one aspect of Oblivion that I've been able to explore that really stands
out to me is the ability to create your own spells. You can get really creative
with all of the different things you can combine, but I understand why Skyrim
took this bit out. You can make super powerful spells that will kill any enemy
with a single touch. I think Skyrim tried to correct some of the brokenness
that happened in Oblivion, but in my opinion, I think the brokenness of
Oblivion is what makes it so beautiful.
